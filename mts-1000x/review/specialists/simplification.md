# Simplification Specialist Review Checklist

Scope: Apply when this subject is affected by the requested diff.
Output: JSON objects, one finding per line. Schema:
{"severity":"INFORMATIONAL","confidence":N,"path":"file","line":N,"category":"delete|stdlib|native|speculative|shrink","summary":"...","fix":"...","lines_removable":N,"advisory":true,"fingerprint":"path:line:category","specialist":"simplification"}
Required: severity (always INFORMATIONAL), confidence, path, category, summary, advisory (always true), specialist.
Optional: line, fix, fingerprint, evidence, lines_removable (the net lines deleted if the fix is applied — the merge step sums this for the `net:` footer).
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

Findings from this pass are advisory. Do not weaken validation or remove required behavior for a smaller diff. Apply changes only within a requested cleanup/fix scope.

---

## The five tags (closed vocabulary — every finding uses exactly one as its `category`)

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `speculative:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines — only when the reduction is ≥5 lines. Show the shorter form.

## Finding style — one line each, location + what to cut + what replaces it

❌ "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?"

A shorter replacement must preserve the actual contract. A substring check is not a substitute for required email validation.

✅ `{"severity":"INFORMATIONAL","confidence":9,"path":"app/dates.ts","line":4,"category":"native","summary":"moment.js imported for one format call","fix":"Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps","lines_removable":3,"advisory":true,"specialist":"simplification"}`

✅ `{"severity":"INFORMATIONAL","confidence":8,"path":"repo.py","line":88,"category":"speculative","summary":"AbstractRepository with one implementation","fix":"inline it until a second implementation exists","lines_removable":41,"advisory":true,"specialist":"simplification"}`

✅ `{"severity":"INFORMATIONAL","confidence":7,"path":"sync.ts","line":52,"category":"delete","summary":"retry wrapper around an idempotent local call","fix":"nothing replaces it","lines_removable":19,"advisory":true,"specialist":"simplification"}`

## What to hunt

- Dependencies the stdlib or platform already ships (`<input type="date">` over a picker lib, CSS over JS, DB constraint over app code)
- Single-implementation interfaces, factories with one product, wrappers that only delegate
- Files exporting one thing, dead flags and config, hand-rolled stdlib
- Manual loops that a built-in expresses in one line (≥5 lines saved only)

## Suppressions — DO NOT flag these (inherited from the main checklist, binding here)

- "X is redundant with Y" when the redundancy is harmless and aids readability
- Consistency-only changes (wrapping a value in a conditional to match how another constant is guarded)
- Tests, error paths, edge-case branches, input validation, security measures, accessibility — NEVER deletion targets; preserve required behavior and protections
- A single smoke test or assert-based self-check — that is the completeness minimum, not bloat
- Explicitly accepted scope cuts with rationale and an upgrade condition verified in project notes; an unverified marker alone is not a suppression.
- ANYTHING already addressed in the diff you're reviewing — read the FULL diff before commenting
